# Advent Of Code
Contains solutions to Advent of Code Problems. I've tried to keep all the solutions beginner friendly and readable with comments where it may be confusing.

To run a solution, Go to the year folder, download the folder for one of the days, open it and then run `javac *.java` and `java Part1` or `java Part2` from within the folder using a terminal.

**NOTE**: Use Java version > 8

Those who do no understand a certain part of my code can raise an issue to ask a question. Also please consider leaving a star if you liked or learnt anything from my repository. Thank You!
